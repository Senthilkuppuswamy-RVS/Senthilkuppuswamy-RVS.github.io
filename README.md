# Portfolio Project

This web page has my biodata, introduction video and my projects. I have added three projects using HTML, CSS & JavaScript. I have tried different font styles, text styles, included grid for web page layout, different icons, images with different widths and Bootstrap navigation bar.

#### PacMen Repo
<a href = "https://senthilkuppuswamy-rvs.github.io/PacMen"> PacMen </a>

This Project creates PacMen on demand. These PacMen are made to move across the Page. The PacMen created moves in different velocities. 

#### Eye-Rotation Repo
<a href = "https://senthilkuppuswamy-rvs.github.io/Eye-Rotation"> Eye Rotation </a> 

This Project has two eyes which follows the mouse movement.

#### RealTime_Bus-Tracker

This Project uses MBTA data to determine the stops between Harvard and MIT.
